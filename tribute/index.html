            <h2>Father of Shonen Anime</h2>
            <p><b>Akira Toriyama </b>(Japanese: 鳥山明, Hepburn: Toriyama Akira, April 5, 1955 – March 1, 2024[1]) was a Japanese manga artist and character designer. He first achieved mainstream recognition for creating the popular manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball (his most famous work) and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Toriyama came to be regarded as one of the most important authors in the history of manga with his works highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.

                He earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen manga with Dr. Slump, and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended.
                
                His next series, Dragon Ball, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold 260 million copies worldwide,[2][a][c] it is one of the best-selling manga series of all time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts.</p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>About Drunken Master (1978): If I hadn't seen this movie, I would never have come up with Dragonball.</li>
                <li>His favourite "Dragonball" character: I believe mine would be Piccolo. He was the first character in my manga where I was like, "He has a scary face, but he's so cool!" It really is cliché when bad guys turn into good guys, but it just feels great drawing it!</li>
                <li>About Blue Dragon (2007): "This may be my final anime, I'm a little worried (about it). There's incredible pressure, but at the same time, there's a sense of accomplishment - that it's worth doing. Blue Dragon will be a masterpiece, not simply because I'm working hard on it, but because the staff is expecting nothing less."</li>
                <li>Nightmares never last. One day you wake up and they're gone.</li>
                <li>Too much fantasy loses reality, too much hope may seem somehow empty.</li>
                <li>Move well, study well, play well, eat well, rest well - That is the Turtle Master way!</li>
                <li>
                    Tackle life with as much energy as Goku! I'll try to do the same!
